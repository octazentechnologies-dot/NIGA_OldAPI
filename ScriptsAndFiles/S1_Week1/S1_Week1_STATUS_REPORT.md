# S1 Week 1 status report

Excel was **not** edited. This file is the delivery record for S1 Week 1 (API + database + in-scope web).

## Scope applied

- **Skipped:** QA, PRE/client gates, Mobile UI/UX/client/Frontend (PAT-*, DMO-*, Track=Mobile).
- **In scope:** Web API (existing on Old-API, new HTTP on New-API), SQL you run manually, family/caregiver SPA, GetMenuByRole consume.
- **Not rebuilt:** Admin clinical masters. No third API. Login / Rx-write / Razorpay stay on classic (Old-API).

## SQL pack (you run)

Same files under `NIGA_NewAPI/ScriptsAndFiles/S1_Week1` and `NIGA_OldAPI/ScriptsAndFiles/S1_Week1`:

1. `00_README_S1_Week1_RUN_ORDER.md`
2. `01_SEC_M01_Foundation_Security_Server.sql`
3. `02_ADM_M02_W7_MenuMaster_Account_Pharmacy_Seed.sql`
4. `03_CON_M16_Family_Caregiver.sql`
5. `04_VERIFY_S1_Week1.sql`

Database is shared. Run once on `HomeoCentrum_*`.

## Code shipped this week

| ID | Change | Where |
|----|--------|-------|
| SEC-05.02 | Removed `UseDirectoryBrowser` on `/attachments` and `/Blogs` | New-API `Program.cs` |
| CON-02.04 | Caregiver Grant requires OTP (`Action=GrantCaregiver`) unless AdminPortal | New-API `CaregiverController` |
| SEC-05.01 | JWT `DoctorID` / caller userId checks on patient, appointment, Rx, notes, labs, case history | Old-API controllers + `DoctorOwnership` |
| ADM-B04.03 | SPA calls `GET /api/mastersAPI/GetMenuByRole`; hardcoded fallback | `LayoutMenuContext.js` |
| CON-01.03 | Family members SPA | `/family` |
| CON-02.03 | Caregiver grant/revoke + OTP SPA | `/caregiver` |
| FND-* | Shared-key / dual-API / role notes in README + this report | scripts pack |

Both APIs compile (0 errors) to a temp output folder. Running `Niga-Web` / Old-API processes lock `bin/` until restart.

## Test / proof guide

Restart New-API and Old-API after SQL + this code (file locks otherwise).

### Database

1. Run scripts 01 → 02 → 03 then `04_VERIFY_S1_Week1.sql`.
2. Proof: `UserPassword` length 500; tables Consent/OTP/Audit/SecureDocument/Family; RoleMaster Patient/Account/PharmacyPartner; Account/Pharmacy MenuMaster rows.

### Auth (classic login stays Old-API path via UI `loginApi` → New-API Account is already used by this SPA)

UI `loginApi` posts to New-API. Confirm JWT contains `RoleId`, `RoleName`/`role`, `DoctorID` for doctors, `NameIdentifier` = UserId.
Login once so plaintext hashes migrate to `PBKDF2$v1$…`.

### SEC-05.02 directory browsing

- `GET http://localhost:5038/attachments/` must **not** list files (no directory index).
- Direct file URL still works if the file exists and static files are enabled.

### SEC-05.01 ownership

Old-API (`:5001`) with Doctor A JWT:

- `GET /api/patientApp/{id}` for Doctor B appointment → 403.
- `POST /api/patientApp` with another DoctorId → 403 (JWT DoctorId bound when missing).
- `GET /api/patient/{otherUserId}` → 403 unless AdminPortal.
- Rx `PrescriptionRubricDetail?appointmentId=` for another doctor → 403.
- Labs `GET /api/PatientLab/GetPatientLabOrder` (all) → 403 unless Admin; JWT required.
- Admin/Management JWT still allowed.

New-API: `GET /api/PatientApp/{id}` and `GetCasesByUser` now also enforce ownership.

### CON-02.04 caregiver OTP

1. Patient JWT: `POST /api/Family/LinkPrimary` `{ "patientId": N }`.
2. `POST /api/Otp/RequestOtp` `{ "action":"GrantCaregiver", "entityType":"Patient", "entityId":"N", "destination":"9999999999" }`.
3. In Development, response `data.devCode` is the stub code.
4. `POST /api/Caregiver/Grant` with `otpChallengeId` + `otpCode` → 200.
5. Same Grant without OTP → 400. Wrong doctor/patient OTP → 400. AdminPortal may omit OTP.

### CON-01.03 / CON-02.03 SPA

1. Login as Patient (or Doctor — Family/Caregiver also on More menu).
2. Open `/family`: link primary PatientId, add/edit/delete member.
3. Open `/caregiver`: request OTP, grant, list mine, revoke.

### ADM-B04.03 menu

1. After SQL 02, login as Account user.
2. Network: `GET /api/mastersAPI/GetMenuByRole?userId=` returns Account menus.
3. Top nav uses those items (URLs like `/account/home` mapped to `/accountdashboard`).
4. If API 404/empty, hardcoded Account/Pharmacy/admin menus still show.

### Dual-API reminder

- New domain HTTP: New-API `:5038` (`nigahomeoAPI`).
- Classic write paths that were already Old-API stay there.
- Shared keys: `DoctorId`, `PatientId`, `PatientAppId` / appointment id, JWT `UserId`.
